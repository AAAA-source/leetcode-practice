Intuition
First , we use the hash table to store the words that appeared in bannedWords.
Then , we check all the words in message . and use "count" variable to record the banned word appear time.

Approach
in C++ , we use unordered_set to store the string

Complexity
Time complexity: O( n + m ) for storing m strings in hash table and find n strings in hash table
Space complexity: O(m) for the hash table that storing m strings


Code
class Solution {
public:
    bool reportSpam(vector<string>& message, vector<string>& bannedWords) {
        unordered_set<string> appear ; 
        for( auto &s : bannedWords ) 
            appear.insert(s) ;

        int count = 0 ;
        for( auto &s : message ) {
            if ( appear.find(s) != appear.end() )
                count++ ;
        }

        return count >= 2 ;
    }
};
