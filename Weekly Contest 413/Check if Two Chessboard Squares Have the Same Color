Intuition
if two grids are the same color , the distance between two grids must to be a even number , so we only check if the distance is even number

In the contest , I figure that there are two way to let the distance become even number
(1) row distance is even , column distance is even
(2) row distance is odd , column distance is odd

Complexity
Time complexity: O(1) for checking
Space complexity: O(1) for variables

Code
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkTwoChessboards(string coordinate1, string coordinate2) {
        int row = abs( coordinate1[0] - coordinate2[0] ) ; 
        int column = abs( coordinate1[1] - coordinate2[1] ) ;

        return ( row % 2 == 1 && column % 2 == 1 ) || 
                (row % 2 == 0 && column % 2 == 0) ;
    }
};
